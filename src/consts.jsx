            The Giza Pyramids, built to endure an eternity, have done just that.
            The monumental tombs are relics of Egypt&#39;s Old Kingdom era and
            were constructed some 4,500 years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            Egypt&#39;s pharaohs expected to become gods in the afterlife. To
            prepare for the next world they erected temples to the gods and
            massive pyramid tombs for themselves—filled with all the things each
            ruler would need to guide and sustain himself in the next world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pharaoh Khufu began the first Giza pyramid project, circa 2550 B.C.
            His Great Pyramid is the largest in Giza and towers some 481 feet
            (147 meters) above the plateau. Its estimated 2.3 million stone
            blocks each weigh an average of 2.5 to 15 tons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Khufu&#39;s son, Pharaoh Khafre, built the second pyramid at Giza,
            circa 2520 B.C. His necropolis also included the Sphinx, a
            mysterious limestone monument with the body of a lion and a
            pharaoh&#39;s head. The Sphinx may stand sentinel for the
            pharaoh&#39;s entire tomb complex.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third of the Giza Pyramids is considerably smaller than the
            first two. Built by Pharaoh Menkaure circa 2490 B.C., it featured a
            much more complex mortuary temple.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each massive pyramid is but one part of a larger complex, including
            a palace, temples, solar boat pits, and other features.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building Boom The ancient engineering feats at Giza were so
            impressive that even today scientists can&#39;t be sure how the
            pyramids were built. Yet they have learned much about the people who
            built them and the political power necessary to make it happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The builders were skilled, well-fed Egyptian workers who lived in a
            nearby temporary city. Archaeological digs on the fascinating site
            have revealed a highly organized community, rich with resources,
            that must have been backed by strong central authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            It&#39;s likely that communities across Egypt contributed workers,
            as well as food and other essentials, for what became in some ways a
            national project to display the wealth and control of the ancient
            pharaohs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such revelations have led Zahi Hawass, secretary general of
            Egypt&#39;s Supreme Council of Antiquities and a National Geographic
            explorer-in-residence, to note that in one sense it was the Pyramids
            that built Egypt—rather than the other way around.
          </p>
          <p>
            Preserving the Past If the Pyramids helped to build ancient Egypt,
            they also preserved it. Giza allows us to explore a long-vanished
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Many people think of the site as just a cemetery in the modern
            sense, but it&#39;s a lot more than that,&quot; says Museum of Fine
            Arts, Boston, and Tufts University Egyptologist Peter Der Manuelian.
            &quot;In these decorated tombs you have wonderful scenes of every
            aspect of life in ancient Egypt—so it&#39;s not just about how
            Egyptians died but how they lived.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Tomb art includes depictions of ancient farmers working their fields
            and tending livestock, fishing and fowling, carpentry, costumes,
            religious rituals, and burial practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inscriptions and texts also allow research into Egyptian grammar and
            language. &quot;Almost any subject you want to study about Pharaonic
            civilization is available on the tomb walls at Giza,&quot; Der
            Manuelian says.
          </p>
          <p>
            To help make these precious resources accessible to all, Der
            Manuelian heads the Giza Archives Project, an enormous collection of
            Giza photographs, plans, drawings, manuscripts, object records, and
            expedition diaries that enables virtual visits to the plateau.

          <p>
            The monumental statue of Zeus at Olympia in Greece was one of the
            Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Created in the 430s BCE under
            the supervision of the master Greek sculptor Phidias, the huge ivory
            and gold statue was bigger even than that of Athena in the
            Parthenon. Worshipped by pilgrims from across the Mediterranean, the
            statue inspired countless imitations and defined the standard
            representation of Zeus in Greek and Roman art in sculpture, on
            coins, pottery, and gemstones. Lost in later Roman times following
            its removal to Constantinople, Phidias&#39; masterpiece captivated
            the ancient world for 1,000 years and was the must-see sight for
            anyone who attended the ancient Olympic Games.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the religion of ancient Greece, a temple was considered the
            dwelling place of a god, as its name naos (&#39;dwelling&#39;)
            suggests. Thus, the statue of the deity inside was far more
            important than the temple itself. The figure was typically placed in
            the centre of the building so that when its doors were opened it
            could look out upon the sacrifices and ceremonies being performed
            just outside in that god&#39;s honour. Whether the worshippers
            actually believed that the god somehow inhabited the statue is a
            moot point, but certainly prayers and ritual gestures were directly
            addressed to it. It is also interesting to note that one of the
            common names for a statue in Greek was zōon or “living thing”, such
            was the endeavour of the sculptor to capture living matter in
            unfeeling bronze or marble. Certainly, Phidias&#39; vision was of a
            statue so large and gleaming in gold that it would be nothing short
            of an awe-inspiring epiphany to the onlooker, it would provide as
            close a link as possible between humanity and the divine.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most complete description of the sculpture from ancient sources
            is to be found in the Description of Greece by the 2nd-century CE
            Greek geographer and traveller Pausanias:
          </p>
          <p>
            The god sits on a throne, and he is made of gold and ivory. On his
            head lies a garland which is a copy of olive shoots. In his right
            hand he carries a Victory [Nike], which, like the statue, is of
            ivory and gold; she wears a ribbon and—on her head—a garland. In the
            left hand of the god is a sceptre, ornamented with every kind of
            metal, and the bird sitting on the sceptre is the eagle. The sandals
            also of the god are of gold, as is likewise his robe. On the robe
            are embroidered figures of animals and the flowers of the lily. The
            throne is adorned with gold and with jewels, to say nothing of ebony
            and ivory. Upon it are painted figures and wrought images. (Book 5,
            Ch. 11)
          </p>
          <p>
            Zeus&#39; throne - made using ivory, ebony, and gold, and encrusted
            with glass and gems - was embellished with relief sculpture
            depicting a wide range of figures from Greek mythology, many of
            which were considered the offspring of Zeus. There are the Graces
            (Charites), the Seasons (Horae), various Nikes, sphinxes, Amazons,
            and the children of Niobe. The screens between the legs of the
            throne were painted by Phidias&#39; brother Panaenus (Panainos) and
            depicted the Labours of Hercules, Achilles with Penthesilea,
            Hippodamia with Sterope, Salamis, and scenes of Greece. The god
            rested his feet upon a footstool which was decorated with a battle
            scene involving Theseus fighting Amazons (Amazonomachy).
          </p>
          <p>
            The figure of Zeus, throne, and stool, were all placed on a base of
            black Eleusinian marble which measured 9.93 x 6.25 metres (32.5 x
            20.5 ft) along its sides. The base was decorated with scenes of the
            Birth of Aphrodite. Finally, the base was signed by Phidias with the
            words “Phidias, son of Charmides, an Athenian, made me”.
          </p>

          <p>
            The statue of mighty Zeus was over 12 m (40 ft) high and represented
            the god seated on a throne. It was bigger even than Phidias&#39;
            Athena Parthenos in Athens. The Zeus statue, like Athena, was
            chryselephantine, that is a combination of gold and ivory over a
            wooden core, with the god&#39;s skin (face, torso, arms and legs)
            being in ivory and his beard, robes, and staff rendered in brilliant
            gold, applied in hammered sheets. Fine details were picked out using
            a wide variety of materials: silver, copper, glass (for the
            decorative lilies of the god&#39;s robes), ebony, enamel, paint, and
            jewels. The clay moulds discovered in Phidias&#39; workshop for a
            similar statue suggest that it was first erected there in pieces -
            the size of the workshop is exactly the same dimensions as the inner
            cella of the temple - and then reassembled at its final destination.
            The wooden core could not have been fully sculpted or the moulds
            would have been unnecessary to shape the outer gold pieces.
          </p>

          <p>
            The master sculptor and architect Phidias (also spelt Pheidias,
            active c. 465-425 BCE), who had already supervised construction of
            the Parthenon (447-432 BCE) in Athens and its giant statue of the
            city&#39;s patron goddess Athena, was called on again to produce a
            similarly monumental sculpture of Zeus. The location was to be
            Olympia in the western Peloponnese of Greece where a huge brand new
            temple awaited. It was there that, every four years, the
            Pan-Hellenic Olympic Games (776 BCE - 393 CE) were dedicated.
            Olympia was then controlled by the polis (city-state) of Elis and
            the sacred site attracted thousands of travellers, pilgrims, and
            sports fans from across the Mediterranean. The new cult statue and
            temple to house it would be fine additions, adding prestige to
            Olympia at a time when there were still rival games held at other
            sites such as Delphi, Nemea, and Isthmia near Corinth. In addition,
            a magnificent dedication to Zeus, father of the Olympian gods and
            supreme deity of the ancient Greek religion, could only be a
            positive for the Eleans&#39; and indeed all of ancient Greece&#39;s
            spiritual and material well-being.

            what would be a challenging project requiring hundreds of craftsmen
            and several years of work. The master sculptor moved to Olympia, and
            excavations in the 20th century CE revealed his workshop, which
            contained a simple red-figure Attic cup or wine jug (oinochoe)
            inscribed in Greek Pheidio eimi, “I belong to Phidias”. The workshop
            also contained ivory tools, a small hammer for working gold, and
            moulds for pieces of a large female statue.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 5th century BCE, the sanctuary of Olympia reached its peak of
            prosperity and a massive Doric 6 x 13 column temple was begun c. 460
            BCE. Completed c. 457 BCE, it was designed by Libon of Elis and it
            was the biggest in Greece at that time, measuring over 20 metres
            (65.5 ft) in height, 64.12 x 27.68 m (210 x 91 ft) along its sides
            with columns 10.53 m (34.5 ft) in height and 2.25 metres (7 ft) in
            diameter at their base. The pediments of the temple displayed
            magnificent sculpture: on the east side the mythical chariot race
            between Pelops and Oinomaos, and on the western pediment a battle
            scene with centaurs (Centauromachy) with the majestic central figure
            of Apollo. Metopes from the temple represented the labours of
            Hercules. Many of these decorative figures sculptures survive today
            and can be seen at the museum at the archaeological site of Olympia.

            Hanging Gardens of Babylon, ancient gardens considered one of the
            Seven Wonders of the World and thought to have been located near the
            royal palace in Babylon. By the beginning of the 21st century, the
            site of the Hanging Gardens had not yet been conclusively
            established. Nevertheless, many theories persisted regarding the
            structure and location of the gardens. Some researchers proposed
            that these were rooftop gardens. Another theory, popularized by the
            writings of British archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley, suggested
            that the gardens were built within the walls of the royal palace at
            Babylon, the capital of Babylonia (now in southern Iraq), and did
            not actually “hang” but were instead “up in the air”; that is, they
            were roof gardens laid out on a series of ziggurat terraces that
            were irrigated by pumps from the Euphrates River. Traditionally,
            they were thought to be the work either of the semilegendary queen
            Sammu-ramat (Greek Semiramis, mother of the Assyrian king
            Adad-nirari III, who reigned from 810 to 783 BCE) or of King
            Nebuchadrezzar II (reigned c. 605–c. 561 BCE), who built them to
            console his Median wife, Amytis, because she missed the mountains
            and greenery of her homeland.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Hanging Gardens were described in detail by a number of
            Classical authors. Though some sources disagreed on who built them,
            a number of descriptions concurred that the gardens were located
            near the royal palace and were set upon vaulted terraces. They were
            also described as having been watered by an exceptional system of
            irrigation and roofed with stone balconies on which were layered
            various materials, such as reeds, bitumen, and lead, so that the
            irrigation water would not seep through the terraces. Although no
            certain traces of the Hanging Gardens have been found, a German
            archaeologist, Robert Koldewey, did uncover an unusual series of
            foundation chambers and vaults in the northeastern corner of the
            palace at Babylon. A well in one of the vaults may have been used in
            conjunction with a chain pump and thus was thought perhaps to be
            part of the substructure of the once towering Hanging Gardens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Research in the late 20th and early 21st centuries suggested that
            popular theories holding that the Hanging Gardens had once thrived
            in Babylon atop a rooftop or terraced ziggurat were perhaps
            misconceptions. Instead, a later theory postulated that, owing to
            confusion among Classical sources, the Hanging Gardens might well
            have been those constructed by Sennacherib (705/704–681 BCE) at
            Nineveh. This research suggested that the gardens were laid out on a
            sloping construct designed to imitate a natural mountain landscape
            and were watered by a novel system of irrigation, perhaps making
            early use of what would eventually be known as the Archimedes screw.

            The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (Bodrum, Turkey), was a massive tomb
            built for Mausolus, the ruler of Caria, c. 350 BCE. The marble
            structure was so immense and decorated with such an array of
            striking sculptures that it made it onto the list of the Seven
            Wonders of the Ancient World and thereafter gave its name to any
            large funeral monument - a mausoleum. Following a damaging
            earthquake, and with many elements cannibalised for the 15th century
            CE Bodrum Castle, the Mausoleum no longer survives. Podium and
            column fragments do survive, while some substantial pieces of the

            Mausolus (Mausolos or Mausollos) was a satrap of Persia who ruled
            semi-independently in Caria in modern southwest Turkey from c. 377
            BCE, and Halicarnassus (or Halikarnassos) was selected as his
            capital c. 370 BCE. Halicarnassus was already a thriving ancient
            city, famous as the birthplace of the celebrated 5th-century BCE
            historian Herodotus and with a history dating back to the Bronze
            Age. Mausolus made the city even grander, adding many fine buildings
            including a new harbour, palace and several temples. Caria prospered
            thanks to Mausolus&#39; control and development of coastal cities,
            which were then able to better capitalise on eastern Mediterranean
            trade, especially with Rhodes. The ruler&#39;s construction of a
            better road network to connect inland sites further improved the
            region&#39;s prosperity and tax revenues came flooding into the
            capital.
          </p>
          <p>
            The construction of the Mausoleum was, according to the 1st-century
            BCE Roman architect Vitruvius in his On Architecture, supervised by
            the architect Pythius of Priene, and the sculptor Satyrus, who later
            jointly wrote a treatise on it. The structure was, like Caria itself
            at the time, an eclectic mix of Greek, Near Eastern, and Egyptian
            architectural features. It was built using Anatolian and Pentelic
            marble on a rectangular podium and consisted of an Ionic colonnade
            with a stepped pyramidal roof. On top of the roof was a massive
            statue of Mausolus riding a chariot in the guise of Hercules, made
            by Pythius himself. The 1st-century CE Roman writer Pliny the Elder
            gives the following description of the Mausoleum:
          </p>
          <p>
            The circumference of this building is, in all, 440 [classical] feet
            [140 m], and the breadth from north to south 63 feet [20 m], the two
            fronts being not so wide in extent. It is twenty-five cubits in
            height, and is surrounded with 36 columns, the outer circumference
            being known as the “Pteron”…above the Pteron there is a pyramid
            erected, equal in height to the building below, and formed of 24
            steps, which gradually taper upwards towards the summit; a platform,
            crowned with a representation of a four-horse chariot by Pythis.
            This addition makes the total height of the work 140 feet [45 m].
            (Natural History, 36.4)
          </p>
          <p>
            Modern excavations at Halicarnassus have revealed that the actual
            dimensions of the Mausoleum (today only fragments remain) vary
            slightly from Pliny&#39;s description. The high podium or base, in
            fact, measured 38 x 32 metres (125 x 104 ft) according to the
            position of the cornerstones still in situ. There is corroboration
            of the 36 Ionic columns and a pyramid with 24 steps. A surviving
            lintel stone indicates the spacing between the columns and suggests
            the overall dimensions of the building were 32 x 26 metres (104 x 85
            ft). A 2-metre (6.5 ft) high wall once surrounded the whole
            mausoleum.
          </p>
          <p>
            A surviving fragment of a chariot wheel, likely from the top
            sculpture, suggests the complete wheel would have been over 2 metres
            in diameter, making the statue some 6 metres high. The tomb itself
            was set within the podium and finds of sacrificial remains (oxen,
            sheep, lambs, and birds) suggest the building acted as the centre of
            a hero-cult, likely directed towards Mausolus&#39; role as the
            city&#39;s re-founder c. 370 BCE. Alternatively, the remains may
            merely indicate a &#39;sending-off&#39; feast for the dead ruler
            before his journey into the next life.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to ancient writers, the famed sculptor Leochares (c.
            365-325 BCE) worked on some of the decorative sculpture of the
            Mausoleum. Pliny the Elder agrees and also records the involvement
            of three other famous artists: Timotheus, Bryaxis, and Scopas.
            Vitruvius adds Praxiteles to the list and informs us that all of
            these great artists appraised each other&#39;s work to decide what
            would be included in the finished structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Mausoleum, then, boasted many full, in the round figure
            sculptures carved on three different scales and painted bright
            colours, some of which would have stood between the columns while
            others stood on the steps of the podium. Fragments of various sizes
            have been excavated, which once belonged to 66 different statues
            (historians estimate there were originally at least 100). One such
            figure, now in the British Museum, stands 3 metres (9 ft 10 in) tall
            and depicts a man wearing a Greek himation mantle over a long Carian
            tunic. A marble frieze with relief carvings ran around the top of
            the podium, which had metal additions attached such as weapons and
            horse&#39;s reigns. This frieze, just below the colonnade, was
            almost one metre (39 inches) in height and included Greeks fighting
            Amazons (an Amazonomachy) as well as chariot racers, although these
            may have been part of the frieze running around the interior
            tomb-chamber. The frieze around the base of the roof&#39;s chariot
            was decorated with fighting centaurs, and large lions stood at the
            base of the pyramid.

          <p>
            The Colossus of Rhodes was a gigantic 33-metre-high bronze statue of
            the sun god Helios which stood by the harbour of that city from c.
            280 BCE. Rhodes was then one of the most important trading ports in
            the ancient Mediterranean and the statue was considered one of the
            Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
          </p>
          <p>
            Made by the local sculptor Chares using sheets of bronze, the statue
            soon appeared on contemporary travel writer&#39;s lists of must-see
            sights but sadly, the giant Helios did not last long. Toppled by an
            earthquake in 228 or 226 BCE, its massive broken pieces cluttered
            the docks of Rhodes for a millennium before being melted down as
            scrap in the mid-7th century CE.
          </p>
          <p>
            Helios was the god of the Sun, offspring of the Titans Hyperion and
            Theia. Not specifically the subject of a widespread cult across
            Greece, Plato informs us in his Symposium and other works that many
            people, including Socrates, would greet the Sun and offer prayers
            each day. One place Helios was particularly worshipped was at
            Rhodes, the largest of the Dodecanese islands of Greece in the
            eastern Mediterranean. There he was the most important deity, their
            patron god, and honoured by the Halieia festival, the highlight of
            the island&#39;s religious calendar and a Pan-Hellenic games much
            like the ancient Olympic Games. Indeed, in the island&#39;s founding
            mythology, its very name derives from the nymph Rhodos, who bore
            seven sons to Helios. In the Hellenistic period (the 4th to 1st
            century BCE), Helios and the god Apollo would become practically
            synonymous.
          </p>
          <p>
            The city of Rhodes, with its five harbours, was ideally placed on
            the island of the same name to prosper from trade during the
            Hellenistic domination of the Mediterranean under Alexander the
            Great&#39;s successors, especially when more and more cities were
            established in the East. The island&#39;s wealth and strategic
            position on trade routes did not go unnoticed by ambitious foreign
            rulers. Antigonus I (c. 382 - 301 BCE), one of Alexander&#39;s
            successors who controlled Macedon and northern Greece, was one such
            ruler, and he sent his son Demetrius I of Macedon (c. 336 - c. 282
            BCE) to attack Rhodes in 305-4 BCE. The island&#39;s recent alliance
            with Antigonus&#39; rival Ptolemy I (c. 366 - 282 BCE) in Egypt was
            another reason to attack Rhodes and neutralise its powerful naval
            fleet.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a 12-month siege, the Rhodians and their formidable
            fortifications stood firm, and Demetrius negotiated a truce and
            abandoned the blockade. The Macedonian prince gained his nickname
            “the Besieger of Cities” but not much else. Demetrius left behind so
            much siege engine material, including one 36.5 metres (120 ft) high
            tower, that the Rhodians were able to sell it off for a handsome
            profit. The polis or city-state already had plenty of money from its
            lucrative control of trade and there seemed no better way to spend
            this new windfall than on a massive statue in honour of their patron
            god, a move which celebrated the island&#39;s hard-won freedom and
            which might perhaps perpetuate the good times the island was
            enjoying in the 4th century BCE.
          </p>
          <p>
            The man commissioned with the Herculean task of sculpting the giant
            Helios was Chares of Lindus (a city on Rhodes). The project would
            not be finished until c. 280 BCE, and as the 1st-century CE Roman
            writer Pliny the Elder noted, it cost 300 talents and took at least
            12 years to complete the bronze figure which stood some 70 cubits or
            33 metres (108 ft) high. It is likely that the bronze outer shell,
            presumably applied in sheets and assembled on site, was supported by
            internal struts made of iron and certain pieces were weighted with
            stones to increase the figure&#39;s stability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Helios was usually envisaged and represented in art as a
            charioteer with a sun-beamed halo riding across the sky and dragging
            the sun behind him, the Rhodians perhaps went for a more statuesque
            representation for their colossal figure. Unlike many other
            super-famous sculptures from antiquity, though, there are no
            surviving representations or scale models of the Colossus in other
            ancient art forms to help reconstruct in detail what the Colossus
            may have looked like. If the depictions of Helios on the Hellenistic
            silver coins of Rhodes are anything to go by, we can speculate that
            the statue may have had the god with his usual crown of pointed
            sunbeams. A relief of Helios on a stone from a temple at Rhodes has
            the god shading his eyes with one hand but whether this was
            replicating the stance of the Colossus or not is unknown. Similarly,
            the popular belief that the statue was holding a torch like the US
            Statue of Liberty is based on the misreading of a later Rhodian
            poem, thus confusing a real light with the metaphor of one in the
            statue&#39;s original base inscription.
          </p>
          <p>
            The exact location of the statue is not known as no ancient writer
            bothered to say, but the eastern side of the harbour is the most
            likely spot. Certainly, later Roman statues at ports like Ostia had
            statues near their harbours which may have mimicked the great
            example at Rhodes. The medieval fortress of Saint Nicholas, itself
            built on the site of an earlier church dedicated to the same saint,
            still stands on the Mandraki harbour mole. Pagan monument sites were
            often reused by Christians as a potent symbol of the new order, and
            there was a tradition in medieval times that the broken feet of the
            Colossus once stood here. More concrete evidence, well, actually
            sandstone evidence, is a large circle of cut blocks which could have
            served as the foundation for the statue&#39;s base. In addition,
            there are fine, slightly curved marble blocks randomly used in the
            fortresses&#39; walls which date to the 3rd century BCE, as well as
            odd-shaped stones which may have been part of the weights used in
            the statue&#39;s interior.
          </p>
          <p>
            A second possible location is in the high city centre, where there
            was a sanctuary to Helios if inscriptions and suitable pieces of
            masonry can be relied upon as testimony. The Greeks typically sited
            their statues of deities either in or next to the sanctuary that was
            dedicated to them but, despite extensive archaeological
            investigations, no traces of the statue have been found here.
            Finally, a tradition built up, perpetuated by oft-reprinted medieval
            drawings, that the giant figure stood astride the entrance to the
            military harbour, but the dimensions required for a figure in such a
            pose which allowed ships to pass underneath make it a highly
            unlikely possibility and contrary to all ancient sources on the
            statue&#39;s dimensions. All that can be said for sure about the
            Colossus of Rhodes, then, is that it was massive and that quality
            was a particular feature of Hellenistic sculpture and art in
            general, as the historian P. Jordan here summarises:
          </p>
          <p>
            The sun-god Colossus of Rhodes was pure Hellenism in its flashiness,
            its gigantism, its ambition, its advertisement of commercial success
            and even, though it was ostensibly a religious monument, in its
            aggrandisement of a particular human form. (33)
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the Hellenistic Age itself, the statue&#39;s life was a brief
            one. Too big for its own good, the statue would, like the empire of
            Alexander, be shattered into pieces and picked over by subsequent
            cultures. If ever an art piece reflected a culture, it was the
            Colossus of Rhodes and its unfortunate fate.

          <p>
            The Lighthouse of Alexandria was built on the island of Pharos
            outside the harbour of Alexandria, Egypt c. 300 - 280 BCE, during
            the reigns of Ptolemy I and II. With a height of over 100 metres
            (330 ft), the lighthouse was so impressive that it made it onto the
            established list of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although now lost, the structure&#39;s lasting legacy, after
            standing for over 1600 years, is that it gave its Greek name
            &#39;Pharos&#39; to the architectural genre of any tower with a
            light designed to guide mariners. Perhaps influencing later Arab
            minaret architecture and certainly creating a whole host of copycat
            structures in harbours around the Mediterranean, the lighthouse was,
            after the pyramids of Giza, the tallest structure in the world built
            by human hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alexandria in Egypt was founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BCE,
            and thanks to its two natural harbours on the Nile Delta, the city
            prospered as a trading port under the Ptolemaic dynasty (305-30 BCE)
            and throughout antiquity. A cosmopolitan city with citizens from all
            over the Greek world, the city had its own assembly and coinage and
            became a renowned centre of learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around 300 BCE Ptolemy I Soter (r. 323 - 282 BCE) commissioned the
            building of a massive lighthouse to guide ships into Alexandria and
            provide a permanent reminder of his power and greatness. The project
            was completed some 20 years later by his son and successor Ptolemy
            II (r. 285-246 BCE). The structure only added to the impressive list
            of things to see at the great city which included the tomb of
            Alexander, the Museum (an institution for scholars), the Serapeum
            temple, and the magnificent library.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to several ancient sources, the lighthouse was the work of
            the architect Sostratus of Cnidus, but he may have been the
            project&#39;s financial backer. The structure was located on the
            very tip of the limestone islet of Pharos facing the harbours of
            Alexandria. These two natural harbours were the Great Harbour and
            the whimsically named Eunostos or &#39;Harbour of Fortunate
            Return&#39;. The mainland was linked to the island of Pharos by a
            causeway, the Heptastadion, which measured around 1,2 km (0.75
            miles). The lighthouse, we are informed by a contemporary writer
            named Poseidippos, was intended to guide and protect sailors and to
            that end was dedicated to two gods, Zeus Soter (Deliverer) - whose
            dedicatory inscription on the tower was made with half-metre high
            letters - and possibly Proteus, the Greek sea god, also known as the
            &#39;Old man of the Sea&#39;.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lighthouse at Alexandria was certainly not the first such aid to
            ancient mariners but it was probably the first monumental one.
            Thasos, the north Aegean island, for example, was known to have had
            a tower-lighthouse in the Archaic period, and beacons and landmarks
            were widely used by cities to help sailors across the Mediterranean.
            Ancient lighthouses were built primarily as navigational aids for
            where a harbour was located rather than as a warning of hazardous
            shallows or submerged rocks, although, because of the dangerous
            waters of Alexandria&#39;s harbour, the Pharos performed both
            functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strabo (c. 64 BCE - c. 24 CE), the Greek geographer and traveller
            made the following observations on Pharos:
          </p>
          <p>
            This extremity itself of the island is a rock, washed by the sea on
            all sides, with a tower upon it of the same name as the island,
            admirably constructed of white marble, with several stories.
            Sostratus of Cnidus, a friend of the kings, erected it for the
            safety of mariners, as the inscription imports. For as the coast on
            each side is low and without harbours, with reefs and shallows, an
            elevated and conspicuous mark was required to enable navigators
            coming in from the open sea to direct their course exactly to the
            entrance of the harbour. (Geography, 17.1)
          </p>
          <p>
            The exact design of the lighthouse, unfortunately, is not made clear
            by ancient writers, with descriptions often being vague, confusing,
            and conflicting. Most sources do agree that the tower was white
            (making it more visible) and that it had three floors - the lowest
            being rectangular, the middle one octagonal, and the top one round.
            Also (mostly) agreed upon is the presence of a statue of Zeus Soter
            on the top. Later Arab writers describe a ramp rising around the
            outside of the lower part of the tower and an internal staircase to
            reach the upper levels. Modern historians have debated the height of
            the tower, and estimates range from 100 to 140 metres (330-460 ft),
            which would, in any case, have made the Pharos the second tallest
            architectural structure in the world after the pyramids at Giza.
          </p>
          <p>
            A fire, likely burning oil as wood was scarce, was kept at the top
            of the tower to make it visible at night, but whether this was so
            from the outset is debated by historians, largely because the
            earliest references to the Pharos in the works of ancient writers
            make no mention at all of a light. Later sources do describe the
            Pharos as a lighthouse and not merely a landmark tower useful only
            during daylight. The flame and several other points regarding the
            lighthouse are mentioned in the following description by the
            1st-century CE Roman writer Pliny the Elder:
          </p>
          <p>
            The cost of its erection was eight hundred talents, they say; and,
            not to omit the magnanimity that was shown by King Ptolemæus on this
            occasion, he gave permission to the architect, Sostratus of Cnidos,
            to inscribe his name upon the edifice itself. The object of it is,
            by the light of its fires at night, to give warning to ships, of the
            neighbouring shoals, and to point out to them the entrance of the
            harbour. (Natural History, 36.18)
          </p>
          <p>
            According to later Arab sources, there was even a mirror (presumably
            of polished bronze) to reflect the flame over a greater distance out
            to sea. The mirror may also have functioned as a reflector of the
            sun. The tower, with no light visible, appears on Roman imperial
            coinage of the city (from Domitian to Commodus, 81-192 CE), which
            clearly show a large, narrow-windowed tower topped with a monumental
            statue and two smaller figures of Triton blowing a conch shell.
            These coins show the entrance to the tower being at the very base
            while later Arab descriptions have it higher up. The Pharos also
            appeared in mosaics and sarcophagi throughout antiquity, confirming
            its wide fame.

              The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus was located on the western coast
              of Asia Minor (modern Turkey) and built in the 6th century BCE.
              Such was its tremendous size, double the dimensions of other Greek
              temples including the Parthenon, that it was soon regarded as one
              of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
            </p>
            <p>
              Destroyed by a deliberate fire in the 4th century BCE and then
              rebuilt, the great Ionic temple survived until Late Antiquity and
              the Gothic invasion of c. 267 CE. Once again rebuilt, in 401 CE it
              was torn down for the last time by a Christian mob. Today only the
              foundations and a solitary column stand as a reminder of the site
              where once stood the greatest temple in the ancient Mediterranean.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ephesus (or Ephesos) was a Greek colony on the eastern coast of
              Asia Minor founded in the 8th century BCE, although there had been
              Greek settlers in the area from c. 1200 BCE. The Greek goddess
              Artemis (Diana to the Romans) was particularly important to the
              Ephesians, indeed her birthplace was considered by them as nearby
              Ortygia (for other Greeks it was Delos). Artemis was the goddess
              of chastity, hunting, wild animals, forests, childbirth, and
              fertility. The goddess&#39; cult at Ephesus included eastern
              elements (borrowed from goddesses such as Isis, Cybele, and the
              “Mistress of the Animals”), as did her representation in art, with
              surviving statues, unlike elsewhere in Greece, being covered in
              eggs as symbols of her role as a fertility goddess. Hence, the
              goddess worshipped at Ephesus is often referred to as Artemis
              Ephesia.

            <p>
              BEGUN C. 550 BCE, THE MARBLE TEMPLE WOULD TAKE 120 YEARS TO
              COMPLETE, &amp; LIKE ITS PREDECESSORS, IT WAS DEDICATED TO ARTEMIS
              &amp; SO WAS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS THE ARTEMISIUM. The city had
              an up and down relationship with the neighbouring kingdom of
              Lydia, resisting many attacks but at the same absorbing some
              cultural elements. The Lydian king Croesus (r. 560-546 BCE)
              conquered Ephesus between 560 and 550 BCE, and then funded the
              construction of new buildings, including a great new temple to
              Artemis or, as the Greek historian Herodotus put it, he “dedicated
              many columns” (Histories, 1.92). An interesting archaeological
              find at the site was a column drum carrying the inscription
              &#39;dedicated by Croesus&#39;.
            </p>
            <p>
              There had already been several versions of the temple over the
              centuries at Ephesus, and Herodotus describes the Ephesians tying
              a rope 1243 metres (4081 ft) long between the old temple and the
              city in a desperate and as it turned out futile hope that their
              dedication of the entire city to Artemis would save them from the
              Lydians.

              The magnificent new Ionic temple was supervised by, according to
              the 1st-century CE Roman writer Pliny the Elder, the master
              architect Chersiphron of Knossos while Strabo, the Greek
              geographer (c. 64 BCE - c. 24 CE), reports that credit should go
              to both Chersiphron and his son Metagenes. However, both figures
              may have actually lived in the 8th century BCE and so been
              involved in the very first version of the temple. Nevertheless, a
              treatise on the temple written in the mid-6th century BCE is
              attributed to Chersiphron and Metagenes. Vitruvius, the
              1st-century BCE Roman architect and writer, has the project begun
              by the former pair and completed by Paeonius of Ephesus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Begun c. 550 BCE, the marble temple would take 120 years to
              complete, and like its predecessors, it was dedicated to Artemis
              and so was sometimes referred to as the Artemisium (or
              Artemision). Like most temples to the goddess in the Greek world,
              it was located a short distance from the city as Artemis was
              thought to preside over boundaries (physical or otherwise), wild
              vegetation, animals, and nature in general. According to Pliny the
              Elder in his Natural History (36.97), the temple measured 129.5
              metres (425 ft) in length and was 68.6 metres (225 ft) wide,
              almost double the size of the 5th-century BCE Parthenon at Athens
              (69.5 x 30.9 m). It had 127 columns which were 18.3 metres (60 ft)
              high and 1.2 metres (4 ft) in diameter. The columns were arranged
              in a double row on all four sides, eight or nine on the short
              sides and 20 or 21 on the long sides. Those columns on the facades
              were decorated with relief figures from Greek mythology.
            </p>
            <p>
              The decorative frieze of the temple carried scenes involving
              Amazons, who were, in Greek mythology, supposed to have sought
              shelter at Ephesus from Hercules. The architrave blocks above the
              columns are estimated to have weighed 24 tons each, and the feat
              of engineering that put them in place led to the Ephesians
              believing it was the work of Artemis herself. According to
              Vitruvius in his On Architecture (2.9.13), the cult statue of
              Artemis which stood within the temple (and for which the whole
              project was actually started) was made of cedar wood
            </p>
            <p>
              The foundations of the temple have received some attention, first
              by Pliny the Elder who praises the engineer and sculptor Theodorus
              of Samos for preparing them on marshy ground and thus mitigating
              the effect of earthquakes. Pliny also notes that alternate layers
              of sheepskins and packed charcoal were used to provide the
              necessary stability to support the massive weight of the
              structures about to be built on top. Excavations at the site in
              1870 CE did indeed reveal that the foundations of the temple were
              composed of layers of a soft mortar substance and charcoal. Layers
              of marble chips and charcoal have also been discovered in 20th
              century CE excavations, but neither explorations have found
              evidence of sheepskins.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 4th century BCE, the temple partially funded by Croesus was
              destroyed by a fire deliberately started by a man called
              Herostratus, who became one of history&#39;s most infamous
              arsonists, his sole ambition in committing the crime. According to
              the Greek writer Plutarch (c. 45-125 CE) in his biography of
              Alexander the Great, the great Macedonian leader was born on the
              very same day that the Temple of Artemis burnt down, around 21
              July 356 BCE (the 6th day of Hecatombaeon). Remembering that
              Artemis was the goddess of childbirth, Plutarch noted:
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite these dire predictions, the temple was rebuilt on the same
              spot and following the same design as the original, even better
              according to Strabo (Geography, 14.1.21). Excavations, though,
              have revealed the Hellenistic temple was slightly smaller than its
              predecessor, measuring some 105 x 55 metres (344 x 180 ft) with
              columns 17.65 metres (58 ft) high. In addition, the new version
              was placed on a higher base to make the temple more imposing. The
              architect in charge was either Kheirocrates or Deinocrates,
              according to Vitruvius. Strabo also notes that Alexander, visiting
              Ephesus in 334 BCE, offered to pay the expenses of the ongoing
              construction if his name appeared on an inscription on the
              finished temple. The Ephesians refused the offer, one unnamed man
              declaring that it was not correct for one god to present gifts to
              another god, and instead, the Ephesians paid for it themselves by
              having a collection of the citizens&#39; personal jewellery.
